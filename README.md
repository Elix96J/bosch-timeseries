# bosch-timeseries
This repo is for research purposes and gives insight about the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods I used as well as how to preprocess the data In terms of time series.
The used dataset is the known Bosch Production Line dataset published 2016 on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bosch-production-line-performance).
